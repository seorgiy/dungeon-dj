# Dungeon DJ

This is a music management tool for tabletop role-playing games.  
Designed for use with the foobar2000 media player due to the fade in/out functionality and nice cmd features.

For Windows use only.

## How to use

1. Download [DungeonDJ](https://github.com/seorgiy/dungeon-dj/releases), unzip it
2. Download [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/download)
3. Install foobar to `/foobar2000` folder or specify path to .exe in the `config.ini` file. Portable installation is completly fine, but don't forget to set some  [settings](#foobar-settings)
4. Put your music in the `/music` subfolders and name that folders whatever you like. The first letter of the name of each folder stands for a key that you need to press to play music from that folder. Examples included.
5. Run `play.exe`, don't mind Windows Defender. It dislikes autohotkeys scripts. 
6. Press `Alt` and the chosen Key for music

## Foobar settings
Recomended for the best experience.

* File > Preferences > Playback > Output > Fading > check Â«Enable smooth seeking...Â» & set Â«Manual track changeÂ» slider to whatever your like, 4000ms recomended. That makes music changes like in videogames, so nice and smooth ðŸ¤™
* File > Preferences > Display > Default User Interface > Background and Notifications > turn on Â«Minimize hides, close exitsÂ» if you want to minimize foobar
* File > Preferences > Shell Integration > turn off Â«Bring to front when adding new filesÂ» if you want foobar to stay hidden during Dungeons track changes
* Playback > Order > set Â«RandomÂ» if you want to run music from folder in random order

## Options

* You may turn off the now-playing notifications in the config.ini file.
* Change language between en or ru. Impact only notifications for now :wink:
* Change key for the combination if you don't like `Alt`. Use ahk [codes](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/KeyList.htm#modifier)

## More fun

Actually I made it for use with custom keyboard so you may also like this idea. Using some [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/) or [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) you can become the real Dungeon DJ. Personally, I use DOIO KB16-01:
