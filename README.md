# Dungeon DJ

This is a music management tool for tabletop role-playing games.  
Designed for use with the foobar2000 media player due to the fade in/out functionality and nice features.

## Description

Basically you just play your playlists for the game situations via hotkeys. Like press B for Battle music, press T for Tavern and so on. The player stays hidden and don't bother your small laptop screen. Music can be stored as audio files or youtube-links. Also the fade in/out foobars function works like a charm. 

For Windows use only.

## How to use

1. Download [DungeonDJ](https://github.com/seorgiy/dungeon-dj/releases), unzip it
2. Download [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/download)
3. Install foobar to `/foobar2000` folder or specify path to .exe in the `config.ini` file. Portable installation is completly fine, but don't forget to set some  [settings](#foobar-settings)
4. Put your music in the `/music` subfolders and name that folders whatever you like. The first letter of the name of each folder stands for a key that you need to press to play music from that folder. Examples included.
5. Run `play.exe`, don't mind Windows Defender. It dislikes autohotkeys scripts. 
6. Press `Alt` and the chosen Key for music
7. **Optional.** Check out recommended [Foobar settings](#foobar-settings) for the best experience.
7. **Optional.** Install Foobar youtube-component if you want to add music from the Youtube videos.

## Foobar settings

* File â†’ Preferences â†’ Playback â†’ Output â†’ Fading â†’ check Â«Enable smooth seeking...Â» & set Â«Manual track changeÂ» slider to whatever your like, 4000ms recommended. That makes music changes like in videogames, so nice and smooth ðŸ¤™
* File â†’ Preferences â†’ Display â†’ Default User Interface â†’ Background and Notifications â†’ turn on Â«Minimize hides, close exitsÂ» if you want to minimize foobar
* File â†’ Preferences â†’ Shell Integration â†’ turn off Â«Bring to front when adding new filesÂ» if you want foobar to stay hidden during Dungeons track changes
* Playback â†’ Order â†’ set Â«RandomÂ» if you want to run music from folder in random order

## Music from Youtube
Foobar is such a great thing due to possibility of mixing local files and youtube videos in one playlist. Lets do this.

1. Download [component](https://fy.3dyd.com/download/). For me version `foo_youtube_3.9_beta2` works fine.
2. Open Foobar â†’ File â†’  Preferences â†’ Components â†’ Install â†’ dowloaded file.

Now you may go View â†’ Youtube Source â†’ Search on Site â†’ type something like Â«ambient musicÂ» â†’ add it to currrent playlist with smooth fade in effect!
But even on top of that you may ***save youtube video link as a file***. 
Just right click on video â†’ foobar2000 â†’ File Operations â†’ Copy to â†’ choose your DungeonDJ music subfolder. Name tarck as you want but you need to add `.foo_youtube` extension in the end.

## Options

* You may turn off the now-playing notifications in the config.ini file.
* Change language between en or ru. Impact only notifications for now :wink:
* Change key for the combination if you don't like `Alt`. Use ahk [codes](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/KeyList.htm#modifier)

## More fun

Actually I made it for my custom keyboard so you may also like this idea. With some [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/) or [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) you can become the real Dungeon DJ. Personally, I use DOIO KB16-01:
